\title{Merge and Clean Daily and Prior Data}
\usage{
merge_and_clean(master_today, master_prev)
}
\arguments{
\item{master_today}{A named list containing today's datasets. Must include `df_proc`, the day's full processed data.}

\item{master_prev}{A named list containing prior datasets. Must include `eligibles` and `prior_review` from the previous day (typically Friday).}
}
\value{
A named list with two data frames:
\describe{
  \item{`prior_review`}{Cleaned and reconciled data from today, suitable for REDCap re-upload.}
  \item{`prior_combined`}{Raw merged prior data from `eligibles` and `prior_review`.}
}
}
\description{
This function merges the current day's processed dataset with prior days' eligible and reviewed data,
filters and cleans the merged dataset, reconciles discrepancies in key WCV fields, and outputs a cleaned 
version ready for review or export.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
  \item Filters today's data to English/Spanish speakers and removes recent no-shows (<7 days ago).
  \item Merges today's data with prior data to retrieve `redcap_repeat_instance` and other WCV fields.
  \item Flags discrepancies in WCV fields and reconciles values based on presence in today's or prior data.
  \item Drops unmatched records and prepares a cleaned dataset with appropriate REDCap formatting.
}
Household-level clustering is not directly addressed but could impact longitudinal analyses.
