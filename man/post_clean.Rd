\title{Post-Cleaning for Full Import List Preparation}
\usage{
post_clean(master_today, master)
}
\arguments{
\item{master_today}{A list containing today's cleaned data, with at least a `master_today$eligibles` data frame.}

\item{master}{A list containing historical data, including `master$full`, the full import list from previous days.}
}
\value{
A data frame combining the cleaned historical data and today's cleaned eligibles, with updates to
        `redcap_repeat_instance`, phone numbers, and other REDCap-ready fields.
}
\description{
This function performs post-cleaning steps on no-show trial data by reconciling today's new eligibles with
a historical full import list. It addresses inconsistencies in household and patient-level data,
updates repeat instances, and ensures REDCap compatibility before creating a new full import list.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
  \item Appends today's eligibles to the historical full import list
  \item Identifies and harmonizes repeat patient and household records
  \item Updates `redcap_repeat_instance` for today's entries where applicable
  \item Clears `language` and `site` for non-primary household records when needed
  \item Returns the finalized full import list for export and future reuse
}
}
